# MokoDoliChimp Scripts

This directory is reserved for build, validation, and utility scripts for the MokoDoliChimp module.

## Purpose

According to MokoStandards, build and validation scripts live in the `scripts/` directory to maintain a clean separation between source code and tooling.

## Future Scripts

Scripts that may be added here include:

- Validation scripts for code quality checks
- Build scripts for packaging
- Deployment utilities
- Test automation scripts

For reference scripts and templates, see the [MokoStandards scripts templates](../MokoStandards/templates/scripts/).
